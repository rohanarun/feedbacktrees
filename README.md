## Feedback Trees
Drop this form in your website, and customers can submit feedback in parallel that instantly generates the code for the feature and triggers a pull request in your private github!

This enables customers to help build the product rapidly in parallel with feedback, and developers only need to test and approve the feature requests. 



The PRs are instantly generated here after you submit feedback on the form:  https://github.com/rohanarun/feedbacktrees/pulls

To add it to your own project, edit the environment variables in vercel to match your github repo and add your openAI and github API keys. Then drop a link or iframe to the form anywhere on your website.  

This tool was entirely generated using Cheat Layer Live Mode in ~3 hours.
